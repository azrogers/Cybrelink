HOWTO-RELEASE: 

Notes on releasing. You will need appropriate autoconf, automake and libtool
utilities to release a package.

1. Commit any unsaved changes. 

2. "make clean"

3. Create html/vX.X.html.  Take ChangeLog entries and html-ify in there. 
   Easist thing to do is take html/vX.(X-1).html and use it as a template.
   Add that file to the list of EXTRA_DIST files in the html/Makefile.am.

3.5. Update html/index.html to refer to this new page as the current release.

4. Increment version in configure.ac.  Put 'alpha' or 'beta' after
   the version, if applicable. 

   eg.
   3.5.7
    or
   3.5.8beta

   Version should be updated in two places: in the second argument of the
   AC_INIT macro and in LIBTIFF_xxx_VERSION variables.

5. sh configure

6. make release -- this will update "RELEASE-DATE" and "VERSION" in the top
   level dir, and libtiff/tiffvers.h.  

7. Please verify that the version info in RELEASE-DATE, VERSION and
   libtiff/tiffvers.h is right.

8. make; make distcheck (to test). 

9. make distclean

10. cvs commit

11. cvs tag Release-v3-5-7 (or the appropriate name for the release)

12. make dist
    Two files with names tiff-version.tar.gz and tiff-version.zip will
    be created in the top level package directory.

13. Copy to ftp.remotesensing.org ftp site. 
    scp tiff-*.tar.gz ftp.remotesensing.org:/ftp/remotesensing/pub/libtiff
    scp tiff-*.zip ftp.remotesensing.org:/ftp/remotesensing/pub/libtiff

14. Announce to list, tiff@remotesensing.org]

15. Update libtiff page on freshmeat with new version announcement.
