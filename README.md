# Cybrelink

This is a small Uplink mod to make important quality of life improvements to the game. I don't have any particular goals here, other than to make the game a bit more fun to play without modifying the core gameplay. 

## Improvements

So far, Cybrelink has added:

* An auto bounce path button on the map interface. This will connect all found links, starting with InterNIC.
* The ability to zoom the world map with the scroll wheel.
* An add all button on the top left of long lists of links (like the InterNIC browse page) that saves all of the links.
* A mail view interface tab, which lists all emails in a simpler interface, and makes deleting a bunch of emails a lot easier. There is no scrollbar on this interface yet.
* Middle clicking on links (like on the main screen) will load your saved bounce path before connecting.
* Middle clicking on an account on the accounts view will fill in its details on the bank transfer page.
* If you are connected to a server that you have a mission for, the mission will be highlighted with a border around it.
* An auto-bypass button on the connection analyser page.
* F2 anywhere in-game will connect you directly to the Uplink Internal Services System.
* Mouse wheel now scrolls the main links interface.

## Building

I have gotten this building on Windows in Visual Studio in Debug. I have no idea how to get it building in any other way. Sorry.
